        <h2>How to implement preprocessing (client-side vs server-side):</h2>
        <p>
            Implementing preprocessing can be done on both the client side and server side. 
            First, let’s start with the server side, this is done using the Less PHP library. 
            First, check if the requested CSS file is found. Then, it changes the extension to LESS. 
            After that, it tries to find the file now with it being a LESS file. The next step is to, 
            read that file resolving magento_import and changes to LESS @import directives. It 
            keeps resolving all paths in the LESS files and then is copied to var/view_preprocessed/less. 
            Lastly, in the PHP LESS compiler, all the sources are passed and results get sent 
            to pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale>. On the client side, it has a 
            similar path to the server side however the files are sent to pub/static. 
            Then, the files are sent to pub/static/frontend/<Vendor>/<theme>/<locale> 
            directory. LESS files with resolved @magento_import directive. Symlinks to the 
            root source file that do not have @magento_import. Also, symlinks to all LESS files 
            imported recursively by the @magento_import and @import directives.

        <h2>The Mechanisms Used in LESS:</h2>
        <p>
            There are lots of mechanisms used in LESS let’s look at some of them. First is 
            <b>mixins</b>. Mixins can be viewed almost as a function in most languages. They are a 
            group of properties in CSS that allow you to use the properties from one class and bring 
            it to another by including the class name as its properties. <b> Variables</b> in LESS can be 
            defined using a @ symbol the variable gets its assignment with a colon. <b> Functions</b> 
            are used to manipulate HTML elements present in the style sheet they are predefined. 
            <b> Operators</b> are plus, minus, multiply, or divide. They are used in LESS to support 
            arithmetical equations to save time when you can do some math equations. <b> Nested variables</b> 
            are a group of CSS properties using properties of one class on to a different 
            class and it includes the name of the properties.     
        </p>
        <!--
            How I implemted LESS: 
            I used a software called gulp to bring my files from LESS to CSS. This does it in a way any time I make changes to my LESS files it updates the CSS files. 
            I did all my CSS in this project through LESS.
