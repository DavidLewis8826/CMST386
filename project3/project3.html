        <h2>Importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience:</h2>
        <p>
            Responsive design is very important and has a large impact on your target audience. 
            What exactly is responsive design? <b>Responsive design is the use of HTML and CSS to 
            adapt a website’s content by either resizing, hiding, shrinking, or even enlarging. 
            </b>This is all done to make the website look good on any device. This is why it’s 
            so important as nowadays there are so many different devices. You have a desktop that 
            can have different monitors, tablets, and phones that all come in different sizes. 
            If you don’t have a good responsive design the website may be basically unusable or very 
            unfriendly to the user. <b>The impact this can have on your target audience is huge. </b> 
            If no consideration is given to how the target audience will mainly be accessing your website, 
            then there will be no idea of how to best format and layout the website. This will lead 
            to your target audience either not using the website at all or having a terrible 
            user experience.

        <h2>Three different kinds of reports that will tell you what information your target audience is accessing:</h2>
        <p>
            There are lots of different reports to help you figure out what your target 
            audience is accessing that Google offers. Let’s look at three of them. The first 
            one is <b>real-time reporting</b>. This can be used to monitor activity on a site as 
            it happens. Google also offers <b>predictive capabilities</b>. This can analyze the 
            website data and predict actions people may take in the future using Google’s machine 
            learning models. The third one is <b>proactive insights</b>. Proactive insights can 
            automatically figure out and come up with actionable insights from the website's data. 
            This could be things like trends or areas where growth is needed that the programmer 
            should be aware of. All of these can be used to tell you more about what information 
            the target audience is accessing.
